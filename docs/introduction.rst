Introduction
=====================

py_geometry is a small package of computatinal geometry routines that have been useful for a number of projects at NOAA/ORR/ERD ([www.response.restoration.nnoaa.gov]), and might be useful to others.

They are all designed to work with numy arrays, and many are written in Cython for best performance.
