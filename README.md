# py_geometry

Simple package for some basic computatinoal geometry functions.

The most useful is a point_in_polygon check -- bulid with cyton wrapping a simple C function.

This code was developed by the federal government, and is in the public domain.

(though it would be nice to give us credit if you find it useful)
